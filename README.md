# 🌌 BPhO Orbit Simulation Project (Gold Award)

This project was developed by **Ujesh Sakariya** and **Harry Atkin** as part of the **British Physics Olympiad Computational Challenge (BPhO)**. We were proud to receive a **Gold Award** for our work.

## 🧠 Overview

This program accurately simulates planetary orbits and visualizes orbital mechanics concepts through a graphical interface. It includes:

- 📈 **Kepler’s Third Law**
- 🌍 **2D and 3D orbit visualizations**
- 🎞️ **Animated orbit motion**
- 📐 **Orbit angle vs time plots**
- 🌀 **Spirograph patterns between planetary orbits**
- 🪐 **Orbits relative to different planets (in 2D and 3D)**

Users can select different models and change parameters through an interactive **GUI** built with [guizero](https://lawsie.github.io/guizero/).
